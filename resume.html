                    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                    <h5>St. Paul Gymnasium – Supervisor/Receptionist</h5>
                      <h6>August 2017 – May 2018</h6>
                      <p>As a Supervisor my job entailed taking care of the gym and its patrons. Each day there was a list of various tasks to be done to take care of the gym to ensure it is all in working order. As a Receptionist, it was my job to answer phone calls, check people in, process any sales transactions and membership renewals, and rent out equipment. For both of these positions there is also an emphasis on customer service, since many of the patrons have questions and it is our job to make sure they are taken care of.</p>
                    <h5>DSW – Sales Associate</h5>
                      <h6> October 2016 – August 2017</h6>
                      <p> As a sales associate, my duties involved many things but we always emphasized on putting our customers first by providing the best shopping experience for them. Along with the emphasis on customer service, other duties involved maintaining the floor, ringing up at the registers if needed, answering the phone and assisting with shoe checks or any other customer questions. </p>
                    <h5>County Market - Cashier</h5>
                      <h6>August 2015 - June 2016</h6>
                      <p>My main job was to cashier, but I also provided customer service to those that needed my help, such as locating items within the store or helping with their coupons. I also did what was directed by the shift manager and kept the storefront clean and organized. In addition, I collected items for food shelf donations.</p>

                                    <h6>2017 – Present</h6>
                                    <p>I currently attend the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) as a Graphic Design major and Digital Media Studies minor. I am projected to graduate a year early from the 4-year track.</p>
                                  <h5>Minneapolis College of Art and Design</h5>
                                    <h6>Summer 2016</h6>
                                    <p> From July 10th-July 31st, I attended a 3-week studio intensive program called “PCSS” (Pre-College Summer Session). During those 3 weeks, I was an animation major. As an animation major we studied various techniques and applied those in various ways such as traditional flipbooks, digital walk cycles, collaborative group stop motion, and the final animation project.</p>
                                  <h5>Anoka-Ramsey Community College</h5>
                                    <h6>2015 - 2017</h6>
                                    <p>I was a full-time PSEO student for my Junior and Senior year. Instead of taking classes at the normal high school, I took all of my classes at ARCC. This earned me credit in both completing high school and college credits.  By doing PSEO for two years, I have completed all my generals needed for college.</p>
                                  <h5>Anoka High School</h5>
                                    <h6>2013 - 2017</h6>
                                    <p>I have been involved in a variety of clubs. I was on the Anoka Girls Swim & Dive team for one year, lettered in French Club my sophomore year, and was involved with the K-Pop Dance Club for 3 years, the last year taking on the role of a co-leader</p>

                                  <p> Helping customers and people in need of assistance, due to my previous experiences with customer service and volunteering, has lead me to be able to excel and gain a great understanding in social services. While I enjoy peace and quiet, as any normal person would, I find and have been told that I am a natural leader who works great with other people and is open to new direction and can easily adapt to changes. I have experience with programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Clip Studio Paint, to name a few. I am also certified in CPR and First Aid; my parents are nurses so naturally I have a strong concern for others’ well-being.</p>
